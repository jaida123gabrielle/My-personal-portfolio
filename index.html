      <h3> The Scoop On Me </h3>
      <p> Ya girl's a vallejo native (vallejo's a small bay area town) with a passionate interest in civil rights, computer sciences, and fashion styling. My name is Jaida Oates and I am currently a freshman at Angelo Rodriguez High School, after I graduate, I plan on attending Spelman University, majoring in political science, and minoring in fashion merchandising. Further, I also plan on extending my coding skills and using them to support the founding of my own civil rights law firm. Lastly, I know for sure that there's a large chance that my plans may change, but wholy, as long as im doing something that is helping my community and people advance towards greatness, I will be happy. P.S. I have an extravagantly wide range of music in my bay area ridden playlist, so I thought I share that with you in the given link. </p>
