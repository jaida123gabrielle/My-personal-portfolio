      <h3> Why You're Here </h3>
      <p> The whole point of this website is to track my progression as I reach my current goals, whether it be coding my first app or organizing a civil rights march. My hopes are for this platform to encourage those around me to go whatever lengths to reach their goals despite the odds. A key component of this platform is not only showing my successes but also my fails, because that is where I gain the most knowledge and experience. Lastly, this personal portfolio will also help me to look back and gain encouragement for all of the things I've struggled with and conquered.  </p>
